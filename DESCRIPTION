Description: Add an extra graphical display at the bottom of a heat map,
 indicating for each column a) whether it has one of several binary properties
 or not, and b) the value of a quantitative variable. A cutting threshold for
 the sample dendrogram can also be specified, and the resulting clustering of
 the columns is indicated by coloring both the dendrogram and the extra variable 
 display.
